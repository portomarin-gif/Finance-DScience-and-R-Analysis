# Finance Data Science & Risk Analysis

The aim of this repository is to let my progress doing an intensive self learning project exploring the utilities and basics of data science (VaR, Monte Carlo, Stress Testing, Portfolio Analytics, etc). At the end, it works as an incentive to introduce me to the world of programming mixed with finance, through statistics. The plan is now to start a roadmap this year from the base (learning Python) to be able to make at the end of this year some big projects by my own. 

## Content
- **Notebooks**: examples: return calculations, rolling volatility, drawdowns, Sharpe ratio, VaR/CVaR, Monte Carlo simulations, portfolios with 2 investor profile.  
- **Reports**: Summary report in PDF format with results and reflections.  
- **Requirements**: Python libraries required to run the notebooks.  

## How to execute
1. Clone the repo:  
   `git clone https://github.com/<tu-usuario>/finance-risk-analysis.git`
2. Create environment/entorno:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open with Jupyter Lab.

## Next steps
- Reinforce mathematical/statistical background.  
- Learn Python from the beginning
- Keep investigating the symbiosis of programming and AI
- Proceed to training **Option B (Quant)**. Other weeks more focused on Quantitative Finance.
